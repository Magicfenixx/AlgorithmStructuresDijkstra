# Dijkstra

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, road networks

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a given source node to every other node.
It can also be used to find the shortest path to a specific destination node, by terminating the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node is known. 
For example, if the nodes of the graph represent cities, and the costs of edges represent the average distances between pairs of cities connected by a direct road, then Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest route between one city and all other cities. 
A common application of shortest path algorithms is network routing protocols, most notably IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) and OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).
